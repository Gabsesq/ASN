EDI File Structure for Carton Labels
====================================

Your EDI file should have the following structure:

Column A: 20-digit Carton Labels (one per row)

Example:
A1: 00108500160000033014
A2: 00108500160000033021
A3: 00108500160000033038
A4: 00108500160000033045
A5: 00108500160000033052
...

Important Notes:
- Carton labels must be exactly 20 digits
- Only Column A is used - other columns are ignored
- Labels are copied directly to ASN rows in order (E19, E20, E21, etc.)
- Make sure you have enough carton labels for all your ASN rows

File Formats Supported:
- .xlsx (Excel 2007+)
- .xls (Excel 97-2003)

How It Works:
1. Upload your original order file (creates ASN with carton-based lines)
2. Upload your EDI file with carton labels in Column A
3. System copies carton labels directly to ASN rows (E19 down)
4. Final ASN file is saved with "_with_labels" suffix

Simple and Direct:
- No matching required
- No SKU or PO number needed
- Just copy labels in order from EDI file to ASN file
