UI
TSC - ask for Shipping # beforehand
Chewy - ask for Bill of Lading
Chewy - mixed labels, may use OPENAI? Or think out some kind of search and organize
Calandar that can track when each ASN is done? Definitely back log
Make sure quantities (Palett vs Carton) are air tight
host this site
Think about asking for some info before processing.
    - This may entail splitting Labels and ASNs
Saving and deleting files?
Printing out files for user?


FOR 20 DIGIT.
    - wondering if its possible to save ASN's while app is open. So if you just upload a 20 digit, maybe it senses the customer name and the PO, it will
      auto fill that ASN? reupload feels kind of clunky

Scheels, Chewy, and Murdochs are all good
